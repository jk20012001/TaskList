 Be especially careful with UINT variables, which must be converted to int before being passed in
 Fetching integer parts
 Rounding
 Take the integer that is greater than or equal to it and closest to it
 Take the integer that is less than or equal to it and closest to it
 Floating-point special remainder function, equivalent to Data % Divisor
 return the fractional part, parameter 2 is the output of the integer part, the sign of these two parts will be the same as the input value
 Turn radians into degrees
 Turn degrees into radians
 TRUE if all elements are non-zero
 Returns TRUE if any one element is non-zero
 whether it is an irrational number
 whether it is infinitely large or infinitely small
 whether it is finite, remove the possibility of irrational numbers and infinite size values, mainly used to judge the validity
 return A <= B or B >= A floating point number, remove the bool value conversion
 Left-hand rule
 Matrix ranking
 IncidentDirection is from elsewhere to pixel
 IncidentDirection is from elsewhere to pixel
 Can only be used in ShaderModel1
 Double type and safe calculation of a*b+c
 Returns A*B+C
 Returns both sine and cosine
 Calculates the arctangent of a given value, no quadrant can be determined
 Computes the arctangent of y/x and can determine the quadrant
 Base on the natural logarithm e
 Base on 10
 Base on 2
 Exponent with natural logarithm base
 Exponent with a base of 2
 Returns the sum of the absolute values of the partial derivatives of the input data, i.e., the sum of the absolute values of each of the two partial derivatives, which is equivalent to taking the absolute values internally before adding the gradients return abs(ddx)+abs(ddy)
 Hyperbolic sine
 decompose a number and return its tail, parameter 2 is the exponent of the output, with a base of 10
 return Multiplier * 2^Power
 Do Hermite smoothing for the specified parameter 3, so that it changes from linear to curved, if the parameter 3 falls outside the min and max range, then Clamp, note that it is not a real Hermite curve, does not involve the tangent vector, there is not much controllability, can only be seen as a typical Hermite curve smoothing only
 Query the number of mip, __VERSION__>=430
 Query the number of MSAA sampling points, __VERSION__>=450
 return abs(dFdx) + abs(dFdy)
 Low precision, not supported by GLES
 Low precision, not supported by GLES
 High precision, not supported by GLES
 High precision, not supported by GLES
 Take its fractional part
 Floating-point-specific remainder function, equivalent to Data % divide
 Equivalent to mad
 1 / sqrt(Data)
 Calculate the product of two matrices one by one for each element
 equivalent to asuint, reads the floating point value as a UINT number bit by bit, without changing the bit value
 equivalent to asint, reads the floating point value as INT bit by bit, without changing the bit value
 equivalent to asfloat, which reads UINT numbers as floating point values bit by bit, without changing the bit value
 Equivalent to asfloat, reads int numbers as floating point values bit by bit, without changing the bit value
